*****-What type of websites?
During this project I scraped movie sites to include a total of the major ratings out there.
They include IMDB, Metacrittic and Rotten Tomatoes Ratings;

******Future Enhancements:
Instead of putting URLs, the user would just enter the movie title and recieve the information.
Create an email list/form where user can put in their email and they would receive a weekely email with the top movie of the week.
